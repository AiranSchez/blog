      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have all wanted at some point in our career to be in contact with people who know a lot to follow them as mentors on our professional development, right? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m glad to report that you&amp;rsquo;ve found it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Professionals and students are gather together in this community to do different activities I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;re interested in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;coding-dojo&#34;&gt;Coding dojo&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Activity in which we meet to practice programming methodologies to solve a specific paradigm. We always get together in pairs to start &lt;strong&gt;practicing TDD&lt;/strong&gt; with the established rules. After 30-40 minutes we get together as a group and discuss the approach that each couple has had. Then we change partners and start over from scratch and, if possible, with a different approach. What is the purpose? To see ** different ways ** to do the same exercise and ** to learn ** from others as much as possible. It does not matter what level you have and the technology you use as long as you learn something new with each session.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
