# Who am I?

I am a ** junior web developer ** who has always been in direct contact with new technologies. Currently I develop web applications in both Front and Back making use of popular and widespread tools in the business field. I consider myself as a hard-working, applied and enthusiastic about new technologies and always focused on results.

I have a Certificate of Higher Education (HNC) in ** web application development ** at ** CIFP CÃ©sar Manrique **, which I accessed through high school in its technological modality. But it doesn't end there, I took a couple of turns through life in college until I found what I really enjoy. For which I have also taken courses (HTML, CSS3 and JS)

After all the situation experienced in 2020, almost at the end of that same year I signed up for a ** FullStack development bootcamp ** taught by the School of Industrial Organization, in which I learned very varied technologies as well as interesting as Golang, Tailwind, NodeJS, Nginx, Vue ...

Currently ** I work in LeanMind ** lending my services to ** Clarity.ai ** as a Data Engineer.
