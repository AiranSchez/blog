# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m AirÃ¡n ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve been passionate about software development for years. I started studying web application development and later did a FullStack bootcamp that broadened my horizons even more in terms of technologies and ways of working.

Since then, Iâ€™ve been working at LeanMind, where Iâ€™ve had the chance to participate in very diverse and enriching projects:
â€¢	At Clarity.ai, I dove deep into the world of data, working with Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Docker, AWS, and testing libraries like pytest and Hypothesis. It was an intense period where I learned to handle large volumes of information and to pay great attention to code quality.
â€¢	Later, at the Technology Innovation Institute (TII), I collaborated in creating a web platform that allowed users to access a virtual machine with pre-installed mathematical libraries directly from the browser. This included report generation and cloud storage, using technologies like Next.js, MongoDB, AWS, and deployment tools such as ArgoCD and Jenkins.
â€¢	Currently, Iâ€™m working with Voxel (Amadeus), in the billing and invoice signature management area. Day-to-day work involves developing in .NET, working with SQL databases, and using testing libraries and CI/CD tools like NSubstitute, TestContainers, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions.

I like to see my journey as an adventure in which each project has given me new perspectives and learnings. And although technology is at the core of my work, what I enjoy the most is building things that truly make a difference for people.
