## Introduction
We have all wanted at some point in our career to be in contact with people who know a lot to follow them as mentors on our professional development, right? Well, I'm glad to report that you've found it.

Professionals and students are gather together in this community to do different activities I'm sure you're interested in.

## Coding dojo 
Activity in which we meet to practice programming methodologies to solve a specific paradigm. We always get together in pairs to start **practicing TDD** with the established rules. After 30-40 minutes we get together as a group and discuss the approach that each couple has had. Then we change partners and start over from scratch and, if possible, with a different approach. What is the purpose? To see ** different ways ** to do the same exercise and ** to learn ** from others as much as possible. It does not matter what level you have and the technology you use as long as you learn something new with each session.

## Book club
Once a week we get together to talk about different chapters of books que read. We usualy rotate books to make the reading enjoyable and not always being the same topic.

## Code review
 Si durante un coding dojo, clase o cualquier evento te han surgido dudas sobre ese cÃ³digo que estÃ¡s trabajando, comÃ©ntanos tus dudas por el chat general y te ayudaremos encantados. O simplemente podemos reunirnos a hablar sobre cÃ³mo empezar con ese proyecto al que tantas ganas tienes.

## Blog post
 One of mains activities we promote in Lean Mind is personal development, so having an online notebook where anyone sees what you are learning is a good way to show the world what you know. Once a week we raise topics to write about and we develop them to get feedback from partners and help each other.

## LM Talks
 Professionals who work in Lean Mind give us a talk about an interesting topic once a week or to show us their personal projects they have been working on lately.

## Open source projects
 One of our goals at Lean Mind is to help everybody around the world by doing software that makes people's lives better. Working for Open Source projects is a really good way to help our world and we want to continue working on it.

## Clases
 about basic or important topics like methodologies, technologies and even some exercises. All these are classes that everyone at Lean Mind give us to help us better understand the more complex concepts at the beginning of our profession. All those classes are accessible on your [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW16ot2jRfF3LgUSCEiGd8g/videos)

## Final thoughts
There are many things that can be done in the community and luckily we can choose those that interest us the most. However, we understand that the amount of things to learn can be shocking at first, so we recommend that you do not try to cover it all at once.

If you don't know where to start, **we recommend you the following ones**: 

* **Start a blog** in which you write what you learn, interesting things you find and small guides for you (or for whoever reads it) on how to do something. After that, share it with us to get to know yourself better.
* **Join our calendar** that we have on Google. Give us your mail on a Slack channel in order to give you access to create events. [Lean Mind apprentice calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=6ka0n1aalvh1kuisi9eapm8ho0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon).
* **Participate in Katas** (Coding dojos), don't be afraid if you think that your level is low, noone borns knowing all and the best way to learn is having mistakes. Besides that the atmosphere is so warm, kind and respectul.
* **Propose activities** on chat. We promote the initiative and every proposal is accepted with open arms.
